# discogs-albumscrapper
Uses bash shell scripting to quickly download a pages worth of albums from any artist you select

Enter in an artist name when the script prompts and it will create a directory in your current directory, packing it with album covers from that artist. Useful for people who need to quickly download pictures for testing purposes. If you need more flexibility I would recommend using the Discogs api. This script calls the site directly and downloads the resources using Curl so be careful not to call the site too much.
